Bush, after being elected by 537 votes in Florida and the Supreme Court stopping the statewide recount, is seeking another term as President of the United States. Bush led the country through two wars, the largest tax cuts in history, a reform in the education system, and much more. <p>His opponent in this race is one that no one had expected, real estate mogul and New York businessman Donald J. Trump, who has ran an anti-NAFTA, anti-war, anti-establishment campaign that politics hasn't seen in a long time. Can Donald Trump pull off the upset and stun the pundits once again and become the 44th President of the United States, firing George W. Bush? Or will the voters not want to change leadership during times of war and re-elect President George W. Bush? </p></p>","image_url":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z2554vyl_R3BooAmi1IaWw__opengraph/img/vAogjzWTzssNIrIgWot49WqQrQY=/0x0:2500x1313/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic1175306.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://www.newsday.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AZTc4YzZhZWEtMDM2Yy00%3ANDg3Njcw%2Fopjan230504.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D770%26q%3D1&w=1920&q=80","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":9,"year":2000,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"2004: Bush, You're Fired"}];e.credits = "Environmental_Cap104";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":77,"fields":{"first_name":"George W.","last_name":"Bush","election":9,"party":"Republican","state":"Texas","priority":1,"description":"George W.
